# Shiny Interface For Watch Your Tone App

This repo holds the interface that creates the Watch Your Tone App, as seen [here](https://cbpascual.shinyapps.io/watch-your-tone-app/). If you'd like to use this app on your own interface, you can download this repo. You will need to contact the Tone Perfect Project if you would like a copy of the voice files. Once you have them, you can place them in the `www` directory in a folder called `voice_files`.

I've programmed this on Mac OS, so you will need to change the WAV Player to have it work on your computer if you are on Windows.
